## Building the Project:

You must have Unity installed for your platform to compile the pong-unity executable. Learn how to install Unity [here](#installing-unity).
pong-unity was originally developed using Unity 2021.3.16f1. I offer no guarantee that the project will build on later or earlier versions.
1. Clone the repository to your system using `git clone https://github.com/loganfin/pong-unity.git`.
2. Open Unity-Hub and press "Open" in the top right corner of the window.
3. Navigate to the location where you cloned the repository and click on the "pong-unity" folder to open the project in Unity.
4. In the top left corner of the Unity editor, open the "File" drop-down and select "Build and Run".

Once the game is built, it should open automatically. The executable will be located in the root of the "pong-unity" folder for subsequent play sessions post-build.

## Installing Unity

1. Visit [Unity Hub's download page](https://store.unity.com/download), read through and accept the terms, and then click "Download Unity Hub".
2. Navigate to and open the UnityHubSetup installer.
3. Read through and accept the license and terms by selecting "I Agree".
4. Select an install location for Unity-Hub and then select "Install"
5. After Unity-Hub is installed, open it and choose an install location for the Unity Editor then click "Install".
